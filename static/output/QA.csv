3. What is the aim of the 'Sampoornata Abhiyan' campaign launched by NITI Aayog?,"The aim of the 'Sampoornata Abhiyan' campaign launched by NITI Aayog is to achieve saturation of six key indicators in Aspirational Districts and Aspirational Blocks. These indicators relate to pregnant women's nutrition and care, immunization, soil health card, school with functional electricity, and textbook distribution in Aspirational Districts and Blocks."
4. What is the significance of the 'Jaiva Gramam' campaign in promoting organic farming?,"The 'Jaiva Gramam' campaign is significant in promoting organic farming as it aims to encourage households to grow their own vegetables, especially for the upcoming Onam season. The campaign provides support to individuals in organic farming by offering vegetable saplings, fertilizers, and agricultural implements at subsidized rates. It also facilitates interactions with experienced farmers, creating a platform for knowledge exchange and skill development. Overall, the campaign aims to establish a sustainable agricultural growth model, promote self-sufficiency in vegetable production, and preserve Kerala's rich farming heritage for the economic benefit of farmers."
5. What are some of the key features of the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) as discussed in the text?,"Some key features of the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) as discussed in the text include:

1. ANRF expands the definition of research to include humanities and social sciences.
2. Unlike SERB, ANRF can fund and receive money from private and international sources.
3. ANRF has been allocated ₹2,000 crore for the 2024-2025 financial year.
4. ANRF fosters collaboration between industry, academia, government departments, and research institutions.
5. ANRF creates a platform for participation and contribution from various stakeholders in research activities."
6. What was SEBI's notice to Hindenburg Research regarding its short-selling of Adani Enterprises Ltd shares?,"SEBI issued a show cause notice to Hindenburg Research, alleging collusion with certain entities to profit from advance knowledge of their report on Adani."
7. What are some of the key findings regarding the Alaskan glaciers discussed in the text?,"Some key findings regarding the Alaskan glaciers discussed in the text include:

1. The Juneau Icefield in Alaska and British Columbia is experiencing rapid glacial retreat.
2. Glacier shrinkage between 2015-2019 was five times faster compared to the mid-20th century.
3. Alaskan icefields account for 25% of global glacier ice loss and are major contributors to global sea level rise.
4. The acceleration of ice loss is linked to a 1.39°C temperature rise at Juneau Airport from 1941 to 2020.
5. The rise in Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) is a key factor in amplifying ice loss across the entire ice field."
"8. How does the newly developed anti-insecticide fabric work, and what is its advantage?","The newly developed anti-insecticide fabric works by having nucleophilic small molecules covalently bonded to the fabric. These molecules can detoxify organophosphate-based pesticides through nucleophile-mediated hydrolysis upon contact. The fabric retains its anti-insecticide property even after washing 150 times.

The advantage of this fabric is that it can protect farmers from chronic toxicity due to repeated pesticide exposure."
9. What is the importance of measuring the mass of the top quark in particle physics?,"Measuring the mass of the top quark in particle physics is important for several reasons:

1. **Testing the Standard Model:** Accurately measuring the mass of the top quark allows physicists to verify the internal consistency of the Standard Model. Any discrepancies in the measured mass could indicate areas where the Standard Model might be incomplete, hinting at the need for new physics beyond the current understanding.

2. **Understanding Particle Interactions:** The top quark interacts most strongly with the Higgs boson. By studying its mass, physicists can indirectly probe the properties of the Higgs boson itself. This helps in furthering our understanding of how particles acquire mass and how they interact with each other.

3. **Implications for the Universe:** The mass of the top quark and its interactions with other particles are fundamental to our understanding of the universe. Any new insights gained from measuring its mass could have implications for our understanding of the fundamental forces and particles that govern the universe's behavior."
10. What are some of the key provisions of the Battery Waste Management Rules (BWMR) 2022 discussed in the text?,"Some key provisions of the Battery Waste Management Rules (BWMR) 2022 discussed in the text include:

1. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR): Manufacturers and importers are required to collect and recycle end-of-life batteries, setting up collection mechanisms from consumers and dealers.
2. Phased targets for battery collection: Starting at 30% for lithium-ion batteries in the first two years, increasing to 70% by the seventh year.
3. Minimum recovery rates for various materials in batteries: Recovery rates are set at 70% for cobalt, 95% for copper, and 90% for nickel in lithium-ion batteries.
4. Registration requirement: Battery manufacturers and importers must register with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and submit annual returns on the collection and recycling of used batteries.
5. Penalties for non-compliance: The rules include provisions for penalties in case of non-compliance with the EPR obligations."
